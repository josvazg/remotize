Remotize aims to aid developers wanting to "remotize" Go code.

Using the Google's Go core rpc package directly, developers that want to call some function, method or interface remotely have to create or redesign a rpc-compatible interface following certain strict rules (http://golang.org/pkg/rpc/). With remotize it is NOT needed to write the interface or a wrapper to an existing one following rpc's rules, because the remotize package will do that for you.

Remotize will build a myinterfaceRemotized.go file containing the wrapping and unwrapping of the rpc calls so that you can directly call remotely:

r:=c.add(1,2.5) 

instead of "the ugly":

c.add(pointerToArgs,pointerToResults)

You can call existing interfaces remotely without touching them or writing the rpc wrappers yourself.

Remotize provides easy remotization, as it's name implies.

Not all can be remotized, of course, channels are not remotizable, for instance.
